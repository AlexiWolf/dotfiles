# Configs

These are my personal dotfiles.  They are managed using 
[GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

## Scripts

The configs can be easily managed using the provided scripts.

- `stow.sh` will store the configs.
- `unstow.sh` will remove the configs.
- `restow.sh` will remove, then store the configs.

The scripts are explicitly stored in your home folder, so you can clone this
repo anywhere on your computer.
